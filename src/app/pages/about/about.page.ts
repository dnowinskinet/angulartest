        <p>
I grew up in Richmond, California at a time when it was listed among the most violent cities in the nation. I was in elementary school when my friend was kidnapped and brutally murdered at a local park. I realized that I shared a similar fate of poverty and violence if I didn’t carve out a new future for myself. My grit and fearlessness gave me the momentum I needed to reach my escape velocity.
<br>
I found solace in my science teachers that were brought to my school by NSF grants. They encouraged me to go to pursue science and go to college. Knowing what it feels like to have people making it their mission to support you has been the biggest motivator in my desire to give back and volunteer when opportunities arose.
<br>
As an extrovert, I always enjoy meeting new people, finding out what they’re passionate about, and comparing notes on what makes us happy. I firmly believe that I wouldn’t have gotten half as far as I have without peer mentoring and developing a small group of advisors to continue pushing myself.
