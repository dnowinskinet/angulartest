I grew up in Richmond, California at a time when it was listed among the most violent cities in the nation. I was in elementary school when my friend was kidnapped and brutally murdered at a local park.

I found solace in my science teachers that were brought to my school by NSF grants. They encouraged me to go to pursue science and go to college.
